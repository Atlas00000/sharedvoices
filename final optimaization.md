# Quick Wins Before Dockerization and Deployment

Here are some quick wins you can implement before dockerization and deployment to enhance your application:

1. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling throughout your application to catch and log errors gracefully. This will help in debugging and maintaining the application.

2. **Logging**: Set up a logging system to track important events and errors. This can be done using libraries like `winston` or `pino`.

3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all sensitive information (like API keys, database URLs) is stored in environment variables and not hardcoded in the application.

4. **Code Quality**: Run linting and formatting tools (like ESLint and Prettier) to ensure code quality and consistency.

5. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests to ensure your application behaves as expected. Use tools like Jest for testing.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize images and assets, and consider using a CDN for static assets to improve load times.

7. **Security**: Review your application for common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF. Use libraries like `helmet` to secure your Express app.

8. **Documentation**: Ensure your code is well-documented, especially for complex logic or APIs. This will help other developers (or yourself in the future) understand the codebase.

9. **Accessibility**: Ensure your application is accessible by following best practices and using tools like `axe` to check for accessibility issues.

10. **User Feedback**: Implement user feedback mechanisms, such as surveys or feedback forms, to gather insights on user experience.

These steps can significantly improve the quality, security, and maintainability of your application before deployment.
