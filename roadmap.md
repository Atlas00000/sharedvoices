# Shared Voices - Backend & Database Integration Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the essential server-side and database features needed for the Shared Voices prototype, focusing on core functionality while maintaining simplicity and ease of implementation.

## Phase 1: Basic Setup & Authentication (Week 1)

### Database Setup
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL database
  - [x] Simple schema for users and basic content
  - [x] Minimal required fields for MVP
  - [x] Basic indexes for performance
  - [!] Note: Database connection needs to be configured with correct credentials

### Authentication System
- [x] Implement NextAuth.js integration
  - [x] Email/password authentication
  - [x] OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) for easy testing
  - [x] Basic session management
  - [x] Protected route middleware

### User Management
- [x] Basic user model with essential fields:
  ```sql
  users {
    id: uuid
    email: string
    name: string
    role: enum('user', 'admin')
    created_at: timestamp
    updated_at: timestamp
  }
  ```

## Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)

### Route Protection
- [ ] Implement middleware for protected routes
  - [ ] Authentication checks
  - [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - [ ] Basic error handling

### User Data Management
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations for user profiles
  - [ ] Profile viewing/editing
  - [ ] Password management
  - [ ] Account deletion

### Admin Features
- [ ] Simple admin dashboard
  - [ ] User list view
  - [ ] Basic user management
  - [ ] Activity logs
  - [ ] System status

## Phase 3: Logging & Monitoring (Week 3)

### Basic Logging System
- [ ] Implement simple logging
  - [ ] User actions
  - [ ] System events
  - [ ] Error tracking
  - [ ] Store logs in database

### Admin Dashboard Features
- [ ] Basic monitoring interface
  - [ ] User statistics
  - [ ] System health
  - [ ] Recent activity
  - [ ] Error logs

## Technical Stack

### Database
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma ORM
- Simple connection pooling

### Authentication
- NextAuth.js
- JWT tokens
- Session management

### API Layer
- Next.js API routes
- RESTful endpoints
- Basic error handling

### Admin Interface
- Simple dashboard using existing UI components
- Basic data tables
- Minimal charts/visualizations

## Implementation Guidelines

### Database Design Principles
- Keep schemas simple and flat
- Use appropriate data types
- Implement basic indexes
- Avoid complex relationships

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- Clear naming conventions
- Basic error handling
- Input validation

### Security Considerations
- Basic input sanitization
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- Environment variables for secrets

## Current Status
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [x] Prisma schema generated
- [x] Database connection configured
- [x] Database tables created
- [x] Development server started

## Next Steps
1. Test authentication flow:
   - Try registering a new user
   - Test Google OAuth login
   - Verify protected routes
2. Implement user profile management
3. Set up admin dashboard

## Notes
- Focus on functionality over optimization
- Keep implementations simple and maintainable
- Document code and API endpoints
- Regular testing of core features
- Monitor system performance

## Timeline
- Week 1: Basic setup and authentication
- Week 2: Core features implementation
- Week 3: Logging and monitoring
- Buffer time for testing and fixes

Remember: This is a prototype focused on demonstrating core functionality. Keep implementations simple and avoid over-engineering.
